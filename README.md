# Repository structure
The repo is divided into many packages, each of which is called as the relative Design Pattern.
Every package has its own main with a little runnable example.
Specialized class methods print their own name or what is going on inside the method due to make the user understand the process.
If needed to understand the workflow, even the client can print some hint about what's happening

## Design Pattern currently implemented:
* Strategy
* Decorator
* Adapter
* Facade
* Observer
* Factory
* AbstractFactory
